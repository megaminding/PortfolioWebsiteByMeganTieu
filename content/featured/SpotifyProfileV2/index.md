Eulexia is an app prototype that aims to comprehensively take care of the needs of children aged 5-12 who live with dyslexia. Our app supports educational equity for neurodiverse learners by offering resources, such as a phonetic dictionary, a study space option, and diagnostic games that assess a childâ€™s strengths and weaknesses across a range of intellectual abilities.
