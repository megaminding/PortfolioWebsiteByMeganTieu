FoodSmart is a functional feature prototype for Snapchat that dynamically populates the maps page with geolocation-based markers to empower users in the discovery of nearby food resource programs. I collaborated in a cross-functional team of 6 and our work culminated a Product Pitch to Snap's Executives!

<!-- Leveraged CSS, React Native, Firebase, and react-native-maps for seamless integration -->
<!-- -Developed  functionality for the addition of user-submitted location pins, accompanied by a bottom sheet modal where users can input various details about the location to enhance the collaborative aspect of the Snap Maps -->
